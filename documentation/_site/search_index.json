Follow the steps to assemble the box:\n\n\n\nAssemble 4 makerbeam xl and 4 3d printed corners to make a square frame. Using M3x8 socket cap screw fasten the corners to the maker beam xl uisng 2mm Hex key. \n\n\n\nFasten 4 more maker beam xl horizontally on to the sqaure frame made in (step 1) using M3x8 socket cap screw.\n\n\n\nSlide the two Feeding_panel   on to the opposite ends of the base as shown in the diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide the assembly made in (step 3) on to the assembly made in (step2) as shown.\n    \n\n\nOn the opposite sides of the assembly in (step 4), slide the  Filler_panel. \n   \n\n\nSnap fit the screen sliders on the aseembly pillars. \n   \n\n\nSlide the 3/4 retina display on all the corners.Start by sliding in the base first at an angle as shown\n\n\n\nStraigthen up the screen and slightly nudge the pillars side ways to allow the screen to stand upright. \n\n\n\n\n\nReallign the pillars to fit the screen into the screen sliders slots. \n  \n\n\nRepeat (steps 6 to 8) to place all the screens. once all the screens are in place. The final assembly should look like the diagram below. \n\n\n\nPlace the  Lid and door  on a flat surface and allign the printed hing plus latch with their respective holes as shown.\n \n\n\nAlign the fastener pins in place with the hole and press fit them to fasten the lid and latch on to the lid. \n\n\n\n\nNow the lid has all its aceesories, its time to attach it to the top of the box.\n\n\nTake M3x8 socket cap screw and using a Multi Angle Vice press the 3d printed thumbwheels on to the M3x8 socket cap screws..\n\n\n\nplace the assembled lid on top of the box and fasten it with the assembled M3x8 socket cap screws.\n\n\n\nusing Liquid Adhesive assemble the excretion panel and wait for it to dry. \n\n\n\nOnce its dry slide it in to the space on the bottom of the box.\n\n\nNB: The assembly is ready for use.
